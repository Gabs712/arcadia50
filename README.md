#### Description:

This project is a Web Application whose purpose is to empower users to communicate with each other across multiple accounts similary to an email website.

In order to store data, the application makes use of _sqlite3_, that has a database that includes two tables:

- _Users_: Registers all new accounts with it's respective username and password.

- _Mails_: Stores all sent emails, including the sender, receiver, message and time when the message was sent.

When an user logs in, an new session is intialized, assurig that the data displayed in the website is referent to the user in question.

As the usernames are not allowed to be equal when inputed by the user, the sent messages can target the receiver by their unique identifier.

The website also offers the possibility to alter the username and/or password if the user so desires, following the same constraints estabilshed by the register page.
When loging a password, what's actually stored is an encrypted hash generated by a third party hash function, so the password is not directly stored in the database.
